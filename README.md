# iMsgQuickReply

iMsgQuickReply is a Pebble app that will allow you to send quick replies to your iMessage contacts. You will need an OS X computer, preferably running as a server.

Setup
=======

If you downloaded the app in the Pebble app store, skip step 2.

1. Please install iMsgBridge on your OS X computer (https://github.com/mkpascal/iMsgBridge/blob/master/README.md)
2. Install iMsgQuickReply on your Pebble (available here as a binary or in the Pebble app store)
3. Configure iMsgQuickReply on the Pebble Time app.
4. Fill the form with your server URL and password.
5. Restart the app on your watch and you're ready to go.

Notes
=======

This is not for everyone and is available just for experimental purposes. Also, please note that the data communication between the app and your server will not be encrypted by default.
I am not storing anything and every component of iMsgQuickReply is open source.
